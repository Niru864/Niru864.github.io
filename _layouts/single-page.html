  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    My research focuses on advancing the understanding and application of <strong>readability assessment</strong> in specialized domains, particularly <strong>chemistry</strong> and <strong>biochemistry</strong>, using cutting-edge AI technologies. I am particularly interested in leveraging <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> like ChatGPT to develop more nuanced and context-aware frameworks for evaluating the readability of scientific texts. My work addresses the unique challenges posed by domain-specific content, such as the integration of textual and non-textual information (e.g., chemical equations, diagrams, and experimental descriptions), which are critical for conveying complex scientific concepts.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Research Questions and Objectives</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Comparative Analysis of Readability Metrics</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>How do LLM-based readability assessments compare to traditional readability formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid, Dale-Chall) in terms of accuracy and comprehensiveness?</li>
        <li>What are the limitations of traditional metrics when applied to chemistry and biochemistry texts, and how can LLMs overcome these limitations?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reliability and Effectiveness of LLMs in Domain-Specific Readability</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>How reliable and effective are LLMs like ChatGPT in classifying the readability of chemistry-related texts, given the biases and challenges of domain-specific content?</li>
        <li>What are the implications of LLM biases (e.g., egocentric bias, length bias, order bias) on readability assessment in scientific domains?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Explainability and Transparency in AI-Driven Readability Assessment</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>How can we improve the transparency and explainability of LLM-driven readability classifications, particularly in specialized domains like chemistry?</li>
        <li>What is the impact of structured adaptation strategies, such as <strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting</strong> and <strong>feature attribution analysis</strong>, on LLM performance in readability classification?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Identifying Features of Text Difficulty</strong>:
      <ul>
        <li>What specific linguistic and domain-specific features of chemistry texts contribute to their difficulty, as identified by LLMs?</li>
        <li>How can these insights be used to tailor educational materials to better meet the needs of students?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Methodological Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>: I explore various prompting techniques, including multi-choice question (MCQ) formats, prompt ordering variations, and explicit rationale requests, to analyze how different strategies affect ChatGPT’s classification accuracy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Post-Hoc Analysis</strong>: I incorporate post-hoc analysis techniques to better understand which linguistic and chemical features influence ChatGPT’s readability judgments, ensuring that AI-driven insights align with the complexity and structure of chemistry education.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Explainability Techniques</strong>: I integrate explainability methods, such as <strong>concept-based explanations</strong> and <strong>feature attribution</strong>, to make LLM reasoning processes more transparent and interpretable.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Broader Impact</h3>
  <p>
    My research contributes to the growing intersection of <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>science education</strong>, and <strong>interpretability research</strong>, addressing the need for trustworthy and transparent AI solutions in domain-specific learning environments. By developing more robust and context-aware readability assessment frameworks, I aim to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhance the accessibility and comprehension of scientific texts for students and educators.</li>
    <li>Provide instructors with tools to select and tailor educational materials that optimize learning outcomes.</li>
    <li>Advance the field of AI-driven readability assessment by addressing domain-specific challenges and improving the explainability of AI models.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Future Directions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Exploring the application of LLMs to other scientific domains, such as physics and biology, to develop generalized readability assessment frameworks.</li>
    <li>Investigating the role of multimodal AI models in evaluating the readability of texts that integrate textual, visual, and symbolic information.</li>
    <li>Developing AI-driven tools for real-time readability assessment and adaptive learning in educational settings.</li>
  </ul>
