            <strong>Explainability and Transparency in AI-Driven Readability Assessment</strong>:
            <p>How can we improve the transparency and explainability of LLM-driven readability classifications, particularly in specialized domains like chemistry?</p>
            <p>What is the impact of structured adaptation strategies, such as <strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting</strong> and <strong>feature attribution analysis</strong>, on LLM performance in readability classification?</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Identifying Features of Text Difficulty</strong>:
            <p>What specific linguistic and domain-specific features of chemistry texts contribute to their difficulty, as identified by LLMs?</p>
            <p>How can these insights be used to tailor educational materials to better meet the needs of students?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Methodological Approach</h3>
        <div>
            <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>: I explore various prompting techniques, including multi-choice question (MCQ) formats, prompt ordering variations, and explicit rationale requests, to analyze how different strategies affect ChatGPT’s classification accuracy.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Post-Hoc Analysis</strong>: I incorporate post-hoc analysis techniques to better understand which linguistic and chemical features influence ChatGPT’s readability judgments, ensuring that AI-driven insights align with the complexity and structure of chemistry education.
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Explainability Techniques</strong>: I integrate explainability methods, such as <strong>concept-based explanations</strong> and <strong>feature attribution</strong>, to make LLM reasoning processes more transparent and interpretable.
        </div>

        <h3>Broader Impact</h3>
        <p>
          My research contributes to the growing intersection of <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>science education</strong>, and <strong>interpretability research</strong>, addressing the need for trustworthy and transparent AI solutions in domain-specific learning environments. By developing more robust and context-aware readability assessment frameworks, I aim to:
        </p>
        <div>
            Enhance the accessibility and comprehension of scientific texts for students and educators.
        </div>
        <div>
            Provide instructors with tools to select and tailor educational materials that optimize learning outcomes.
        </div>
        <div>
            Advance the field of AI-driven readability assessment by addressing domain-specific challenges and improving the explainability of AI models.
        </div>

        <h3>Future Directions</h3>
        <div>
            Exploring the application of LLMs to other scientific domains, such as physics and biology, to develop generalized readability assessment frameworks.
        </div>
        <div>
            Investigating the role of multimodal AI models in evaluating the readability of texts that integrate textual, visual, and symbolic information.
        </div>
        <div>
            Developing AI-driven tools for real-time readability assessment and adaptive learning in educational settings.

        <p>
          Hi, I'm Rachel! 
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a passionate, multi-talented lifelong learner with a deep curiosity for technology and creativity. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in May 2024, following my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo in Canada in June 2017. My academic background in Data Science and Machine Learning has set the stage for my focus on computational linguistics, natural language processing, text readability, and the evaluation of large language models.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical expertise spans Python, SQL, and various machine learning frameworks, and I'm continuously exploring advanced topics like generative AI and deep learning. I thrive on merging data-driven insights with real-world applications, solving complex problems one algorithm at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the technical realm, I love sharing my journey and experiences. I produce YouTube videos about skincare for people of color, and I enjoy connecting with others through creative and analytical projects. You can also check out my <a href="YOUR_LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL">LinkedIn</a> to see a detailed account of my work and achievements.
