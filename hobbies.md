## My Hobbies

Hereâ€™s what I enjoy doing in my free time:

- **Sewing**: I alter all my clothing to ensure things fit me just the way I want them to, clothing is supposed to fit well! I also like to sew clothing that I can't afford.
- **Knitting**: I knit scarfs and scarfs only, I love gifitng people scarfs in my favourite colour yarns.
- **Swimming**: I swim regularly and I taught myself how to swim! This is a personal accomplishment because I never thought I could do.
- **Biking**: Nothing makes me feel the way biking makes me feel!
- **Formulating Skincare**: I am an skincare enthusiast and I love formulating the skincare I want but can't find on the market.
- **Making Youtube Videos about Skincare**: I post honest reviews of commercial skincare products that address hyperpigmentation, acne, sun protection.
- **Cooking**: I make delicious pizza and pasta with ingreditents made from scatch.
